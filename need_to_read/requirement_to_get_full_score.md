Project 2 — Data Stories: Building Interactive Dashboards with Python Shiny
1. Project Details
This project asks you to apply what you have learnt this semester to build an interactive data visualization application in Python Shiny.

You will work in teams of up to 4. The brief is intentionally open-ended to reward creativity, exploration, and self-learning: choose your own topic, source or crawl your own dataset, and use the techniques from the course to tell a story you find compelling. Your application should demonstrate effective visual communication, meaningful interactivity, and solid technical implementation.

The project should go beyond static charts and basic dashboards. Aim for a more advanced visualization problem, such as:

Interactive multidimensional visualization
Time-series visualization and forecasting
Spatial or spatio-temporal visualization
Text or network visualization
Animated visualizations
Interactive analytical dashboards
Visual analytics
Projects must be implemented primarily in Python and must be reproducible and well documented.

Project Questions
In this project, the expected output is a dashboard, which is basically a collection of charts which is arranged and designed in a logical manner. You will need to build this dashboard with Python Shiny. More examples of what you can build with python Shiny can be found here.

This project is open-ended, you can select any publicly available dataset on the Internet. After that, think of an interesting question you can answer with this dataset and build a dashboard to guide the viewer through your story with this dataset. For example, you can find dataset to answer real-world questions like:

What are the demographics of voters in the US presidential elections?
How do income levels vary across different regions or demographics in …?
What is the correlation between education levels and income in …?
How has the prevalence of certain diseases changed over time?
What are the key factors influencing life expectancy in different countries?
How are carbon emissions distributed globally, and how have they changed over the years?
What is the correlation between deforestation and wildlife population decline?
What are the peak times for user engagement on different social media platforms?
How do education levels correlate with job opportunities in different fields?
What is the distribution of student performance in standardized tests?
Your dashboard should have at least 5 charts, and you should use at least 3 types of charts.

Additionally, you will need to deploy your shiny app on shinyapps.io. We believe that the free option offered on the website will be sufficient for this course.

2. Deadlines
Proposal — Due 18/05
Submit the following:

Proposal write-up (under 500 words). A short document covering your dataset, the question you are answering, why it matters, and why the data is challenging to visualize.
Wireframe sketch. A draft layout of your dashboard — drawn in PowerPoint, Excel, draw.io, or by hand. Annotate each chart, filter, and component to indicate what data it shows and how it behaves (filtering, interaction, cross-filtering, etc.).
Presentation slides covering:
Initial project plan
Dataset description
Planned visualization and analytical methods
Link to your GitHub repository
Each team will give an in-class presentation (5 minutes).

Final Submission & Presentation — Due 07/06
Submit:

Source code (in main branch of the provided Git)
Final report (up to 6 pages), written in LaTEX
Presentation slides
Each team will also give an in-class presentation (8 minutes) with a live demo.

3. Deliverables
3.1 Proposal
The proposal consists of three components: a write-up, a wireframe, and a short presentation. Together they should answer what you are building, why it matters, and how you plan to build it.

Write-up (under 500 words)
Cover:

Project description. A short summary of the idea, goals, and the question you are answering.
Motivation. Why the project is interesting, what problem it addresses, and why the dataset or topic matters.
Dataset description. Data source, collection method, structure, and challenges or limitations.
Visualization challenge. Why this data is non-trivial to visualize — e.g. dimensionality, scale, temporal/spatial structure, sparsity, or mixed data types.
Wireframe
A sketched layout of your dashboard, drawn in PowerPoint, Excel, draw.io, or by hand. It should communicate the planned structure of the app without needing to be polished. For each chart, filter, or component, annotate:

The chart type and the data it presents
The interactive behavior (filtering, brushing, cross-filtering, tooltips, linked views, etc.)
How the component fits into the overall story or analytical flow
Presentation slides
Slides should summarize:

Initial project plan and dashboard story
Dataset description
Planned visualization techniques, interactions, and analytical/ML methods
Technologies and libraries (e.g. Python Shiny, Plotly, Pandas, Scikit-learn, GeoPandas, Altair, PyDeck)
Development plan with task allocation per team member
Link to your GitHub repository
GitHub repository
A public repo containing:

The proposal write-up and wireframe
Data files or data-collection scripts
Ongoing project progress
Documentation
3.2 Python Shiny Application
The application should:

Support interactive visualization
Let users explore and filter the data
Surface clear analytical insights
Tell a meaningful visual story
Be reproducible and runnable locally
Possible features:

Interactive filtering
Dynamic plots
Time-series forecasting
Spatial analysis
Animated visualizations
Model comparison
Linked visual components
3.3 Final Report
The report should clearly explain:

Project motivation
Dataset and preprocessing
Visualization design decisions
Interaction design
Analytical and ML methods
Key findings and insights
Challenges and limitations
Future improvements
It should also reflect on:

Why you chose specific visualization techniques
How interactivity strengthens the user's understanding
How ML or predictive analytics contribute to the analysis
3.4 Presentation
Each team will give an in-class presentation and live demo. Cover:

Problem statement
Dataset overview
Visualization techniques
Interactive features
ML or predictive components
System architecture
Key findings
Challenges and lessons learnt
Demonstrate the application live during the presentation.
